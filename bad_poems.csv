After all

In the end 

If it was all just one long, strange, and pointless trip 

Then it was at least interesting

And that's the most important thing in the world.

Mind Fog,maybe something happens which propagates a deep unease that makes you acknowledge the weight in your brain and reminds you that you are unwell again volumous storm clouds roll in and take hold as well you sit with your feelings inside your head it seems as though a thousand years drift by within yourself as you wait for the interminable unrest to pass lightning strikes and thunder cracks internally a torrential rain begins to pour down washing over everything as it clears a thick fog settles over the moors of your heart then you come across a kindred soul your eyes connect and you both sense the sorrow and turmoil behind those eyes you feel an understanding underneath those puffy dark circles you both bare but neither of you say anything as the weight of that familiar pain is all too much so we both walk on and continue with your lives weathering the storm but not alone,"
Maybe something happens

Which propagates a deep unease

That makes you acknowledge the weight in your brain

And reminds you that you're unwell again

Volumous storm clouds roll in and take hold

As well you sit with your feelings inside your head it seems as though a thousand years drift by within yourself

As you wait for the interminable unrest to pass

Lightning strikes and thunder cracks internally

A torrential rain begins to pour down washing over everything 

As it clears a thick fog settles over the moors of your heart

Then you come across a kindred soul

Your eyes connect and you both sense the sorrow and turmoil behind those eyes

You feel an understanding underneath those puffy dark circles you both bare

But neither of you say anything

As the weight of that familiar pain is all too much 

So we both walk on and continue with your lives 

Weathering the storm 

But not alone

there's a couple sitting two seats in front,this was in the year when a ship took leave of the water floated out across the clouds when the clouds became the opened palms of the angels the year when the angels strung their wings across the telephone lines like laundry drying in the sun only there was no sun not that year that came later when the children turned first into horses then into ghosts when the rain fell in love with a poet when the poet forgot his own name then the names for everything else that was a good year a year without names a year when i learned to kneel without my knees ever touching the ground where the gods all prayed to us but i am getting ahead of myself i should start at the beginning,"
This was in the year when
a ship took leave of the water
& floated out across the clouds.

When the clouds became
the opened palms of the angels.

The year when the angels strung
their wings across the telephone lines
like laundry drying in the sun.

Only there was no sun.
Not that year.

That came later,
when the children turned first
into horses & then into ghosts,

when the rain fell in love
with a poet,

when the poet forgot his own name
& then the names for everything else.

That was a good year.
A year without names.

A year when I learned to kneel
without my knees ever touching the ground,

& where the gods all prayed to us.

But I am getting ahead of myself.
I should start at the beginning.

Love is Strange,sitting on a train with my head bowed in a quiet mourning for the couple sitting two seats in front or really for me i mourn for me me and my love and its cramps i am in love i am in love and once more i am in love not with anyone but with everyone or anyone who would see it through then each time i remember that the only thing i want to be is noticed someone can notice that even if i have to tell them to so when my sister tells me about a beautiful boy or a beautiful girl i do not feel hot tears behind my eyes i do not tell myself that there is an ugliness where there once was a child so when i see a person i barely know yet want with every fibre of myself when i see them with someone else there is no clutch round my heart,"
sitting on a train with my head bowed in a quiet mourning for the couple sitting two seats in front.

or really for me.

i mourn for me, me and my love and its cramps.

im in love, im in love and once more im in love. 

not with anyone but with everyone, or anyone who'd see it through.

then each time i remember that the only thing i want to be is noticed,

someone can notice that, even if i have to tell them to.

so when my sister tells me about a beautiful boy, or a beautiful girl

i dont feel hot tears behind my eyes. 

i dont tell myself that theres an ugliness where there once was a child.

so when i see a person i barely know yet want with every fibre of myself, 

when i see them with someone else,

theres no clutch round my heart.

Bead Workers,love is a strange thing is not it many got blessed by the love as it transformed their lives picking them up from bottom and taking them to the heights of the sky and for some its a curse that only put sorrow and misery in their lives once someone said something very beautiful about love and who loves the most a man or a woman by every mistake a man made and woman forgives just adds up love in man s heart for the woman but takes away a little from woman s heart as well so at the time comes when a man loves woman the most is the time when she do not even love him at all strange is not it,"
Love is a strange thing isn't it. Many got blessed by the love as it transformed their lives picking them up from bottom and taking them to the heights of the sky. And for some its a curse that only put sorrow and misery in their lives.

Once someone said something very beautiful about love and who loves the most a man or a woman.

By every mistake a man made and woman forgives just adds up love in man's heart for the woman but takes away a little from woman's heart as well. So at the time comes when a man loves woman the most is the time when she don't even love him at all.
Strange isn't it.

Agate, ivory. Without
alliance, I was told, we

would not fill the air
with our difficult musics.

The audience, then, does
not ever change—

always a mother, and shame,
and absent a worthwhile father.

So I came to know
what it meant to go

alone beneath the full
buck moon, to scratch

a phrase like  fragments
are the only form he trusts

onto the page, but this is a letter,
and maybe one of the only places

I will write it down: suddenly I grew
uncomfortable to be loved and broken

to be loved less than the other

Veterans Day 2022,the ones we see before us today unlike the ones they were they served on land on sea in air they served within their time the old ones that we see today are not as they were then they walk with canes and ride scooters do not see them proudly marching we all may ask why there are wars that call like these to serve why cannot we live in peace today why must we come to arms the reasons are beyond these ones they only did their duty did not control their destinies but served with pride and honor so let us all stand and honor them acknowledge what they did they answered to the call that came and gave their time to us these are the ones that came back home must not forget the fallen those who served and gave their lives will never be forgotten,"The ones we see before us today
Unlike the ones they were.
They served on land, on sea, in air
They served within their time.

The old ones that we see today
Are not as they were then.
They walk with canes and ride scooters
Don't see them proudly marching.

We all may ask why there are wars
That call like these to serve?
Why can't we live in peace today
Why must we come to arms?

The reasons are beyond these ones
They only did their duty.
Did not control their destinies
But served with pride and honor.

So lets all stand and honor them
Acknowledge what they did.
They answered to the call that came.
And gave their time to us.

These are the ones that came back home
Must not forget the fallen.
Those who served and gave their lives
Will never be forgotten.

A newfound fire burns bright within me

that cannot be put out by lifes rain

my soul now flies where sadness is unable to follow

and cloak me with its pain

my spirit defies any chainings treads not unwarily into sorrows cage

my mind laughs in the faces of hatred and evil to hear them screaming in a frustrated rage

and should darknesses think they own my soul at anytime think its theirs to take

how foolish because I live in the providence of the suns dominion into which they will never break

these discovered strengths came from on high I'm convinced when my hopes had fallen to the floor

as I fought my way looking for help found that I

had unknowingly  stumbled through my guardian angels door

 

now my life no longer walks over me but beside me and not one single day is dull

the book of me once empty is now and forever will be full

We was paid of a Saturday night,
Tide us over Sunday morning,
Sunday’s dinner still to be bought
this Saturday evening in November.
Scarves pulled tight against the air
Damp pea-soupers everywhere. 
The market was bright, alight
With candles, gas jets, grease lamps,
The fires of the chestnut roasters
Amongst the cacaphony of cries
Traders calling out their wares:
“ Bootiful sea food whatever you like.”
Butchers in blue aprons dripping
With blood illuminated by gas jets.
Barkers bawling outside the circus.
Peelers parading the slums off of
Oxford street. Everyone keen
To make a penny for porter.

I want to be grounded

like a child rolling 

down a grassy hill

with abandon.

I remember doing that

when mom would pile us in the car & take us to a far-away park.

I want to be joyous 

like the parrots singing

their chatter from the high-up palm trees.

I remember feeling that 

when we would run the neighborhood

with flattened cardboard boxes to use as sleds down dirt fields.

I want to be simple

like dreamy days of old when screen doors would slam shut with a whisper

as children bounced from house to house.

I am an old woman now,

no more rolling down hills,

no more sledding down mountains,

but I can still walk the grounds,

I can still hear the bird song,

I can still go from house to house--

hello, friend, so glad to see you today,

a simple day,

a joyous day.
