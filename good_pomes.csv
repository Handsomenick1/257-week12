seedling by the time packed my things for the plane to chicago had decided was destined to be nomad however would like to have more control over where go and why would like to see most of the earth as long as it lasts home is where one is at particular instant of time belong everywhere citizen of the universe took long look at my sketchbook the astronaut and the sapling stood face to face orange and green under dusty pink sky each time there is something to take and so much to leave behind decided to leave my sketchbook here the sapling should be left so the astronaut can return to get it,"I craned over my sketchbook, my mother walked into the room and spoke some words—instructions to turn off the stove if the rice was cooked before she returned home. But at that moment, for all I knew, she could have been talking about rabbits cartwheeling in the garden because my mind was brooding over a life-and-death problem: What should I take for tomorrow’s school lunch?
In my sketchbook, a graphite astronaut watched a graphite seedling sprout on an unknown planet—or was it the last sapling on a forlorn Earth? I imagined the sapling quiver as the astronaut reached out to pluck him away.
But this is our home, the sapling said.
“No more,” the astronaut replied.
As I sketched its curious, little leaves, the sapling murmured, Where is home, then?
The question flash forwarded two years into the future and knocked on the window of my plane to Chicago. The Italian man next to me repeated himself for the third time as I struggled to hear him over the drone of the engine. “So where are you from? Where is your home?”
I twirled my glass of orange juice while I thought of a possible answer. Should I say Delhi? But I had just moved there. Should I say Noida, the place where I was born but have not seen since, or Kanpur, the town still recovering from my childhood mischief? Or should I say Mangaluru, a city I hated for its incessant rains but was the place where I made lasting connections, where all of my friends remain?
My father’s company relocated him every three years. They had a quirky management style. Employees who requested to go to Mumbai were moved to the other side of the country. Demand too much and find yourselves in a middle-of-nowhere town with one electric pole and two stop signs. My father, however, would say,  “Just throw me anywhere,” and they granted his wish. It didn’t bother him much; he was a traveler at heart, and besides, he considered our ancestral house in the small town of Shimoga as his real home. He grew up among its old red walls, low ceilings, and small windows, as did my grandfather before him.
I visit Shimoga maybe once a year and associate it with the pain of slow WiFi. I criticize my grandparents because their footsteps never fall far from that house. I beg them to come live with us, but they stay stubbornly planted as if they were trees and their roots and the floor were one.
As I debated painting the astronaut in white, my thoughts churned. Nine different houses flashed before my eyes. Countless faces, packed boxes, and school uniforms zoomed past like a train. In came the struggle to transition into a new school and catch up with the curriculum, and out went friendships, time, and money. I dropped the pale paint tube; the bleakness of such memories made me so dizzy I wanted to see no more of that color.
Over time, I noticed that each school had its own culture, its own etiquette. The sooner I identified it and adapted, the easier it was to mingle with students and keep up in class. But there was never enough time for bonding. I was inside an endless video game that I kept losing, having to start over each time. Until I found a way to win.
My mother showed me how without knowing it. There were two things she loved: cooking and plants. Wherever we lived, she grew a garden. Each house smelled of roses, basil, jade, and hibiscus. Each time we moved, it would break her heart, but she would give these plants away to another gardener.
At our new home, she would pluck a basil leaf and place it on the curry, working her magic into the lunchbox I took to school. I discovered that food was the best way to win people’s hearts. At lunchtime the cultural diversity of India would shine. I would lay open my lunchbox and say, “Who wants some paneer?” The entire classroom would attack my food. In return, I got a bit of everyone’s. The Tamilians brought their rice cakes, the Gujaratis their khakhra. There were those who stared at their desks because they couldn’t afford lunch every day, and those who brought Turkish Delight from Istanbul for dessert. Food brought us together. In every school I went to, I started the tradition of sharing food, making memories that lasted. The plants my mother grew still refresh the air of someone’s home, and the food she made has become a cherished classroom memory.
My mother returned home just as I finished painting the astronaut. The air smelled of burnt rice, an awaited scolding, and some ominous news. “The transfer is inevitable,” said my father. I dropped my reverie and tuned into their conversation. Everything stood still. Even the wind chime in the hallway stopped its jingling and stooped to listen.
“Tell them how hard it is to find a decent place to rent in Delhi.” My mother had had enough. She wouldn’t give up her plants again.
“The branch needs me. It’s going haywire without a manager.”
“Those people ask for a monstrous price for a ramshackle hut. Do I smell burned rice?”
The conversation went on for a while. Finally, my father buckled. “We can try to put off the transfer.”
Utensils clinked in the kitchen.
“And she says she wants to go to America?”
No answer. I knew what that meant. Delhi was far away. Moving everything from Mangaluru to Delhi would drain so much money that unless I got a lot of scholarships, we wouldn’t be able to afford something like an astronomical tuition. I could see the hand of bureaucracy reach down and pluck us out of one home and drop us into yet another.
Food was served. We had ramen instead of rice stew, which was fine by me since I didn’t like rice.
Over time, it has become harder to answer the question of home. Each place had a part of me. To ask where I am from implies a fixed home and a sense of permanence. But the laws of physics prevent me from gaining such permanence—I would have to go to a different universe for that.
The universe. So vast, so beautiful. Yet this planet is as far as we can go. If anything happens to our home then, Where would we go? Where would the astronaut take the seedling?
By the time I packed my things for the plane to Chicago, I had decided I was destined to be a nomad. However, I would like to have more control over where I go and why. I would like to see most of the Earth as long as it lasts. Home is where one is at a particular instant of time; I belong everywhere, a citizen of the universe.
I took a long look at my sketchbook. The astronaut and the sapling stood face to face, orange and green, under a dusty pink sky. Each time, there is something to take and so much to leave behind. I decided to leave my sketchbook here. The sapling should be left, so the astronaut can return to get it.

My mother’s favorite. I have asked her to come stay with me for four days, which I haven’t done in a decade. We are not close. I have always felt a tension between us, even as a very small child when I would wake sweaty at night from dreams of her yelling at me. The truth was, that she didn’t yell at me. She yelled at my siblings, who are all more stubborn than I am. I had a fear and a deep, fierce love for her then as most children do for their mothers. Now, as an adult, I have a certain limited respect, a cautious affection, for her through a distance I haven’t known how to close.
She is peeling me a boiled egg. I will find out later that she is purposely coddling me—something she never believed in—because she is horrified by what a fragile bird I’ve become. My olive complexion tends to have a green tint when I’m not well, and I am losing handfuls of hair every time I shower. It’s the stress, I tell her—the recent move, beginning graduate school. My mother cuts the egg into four waxy wedges and sprinkles them with salt before sliding them across the table. The next morning, I will wake her earlier than usual and ask her to come on a walk with me in the wet fall air so I can tell her, out of earshot of my three sons, about my impending divorce.
I don’t need my mother to advise me on what to do about my marriage or help me to get it done. I just need someone to tell. I will be surprised when she doesn’t plead that I cannot have possibly done all I can for the situation. She only breathes deeply like she does and says, “Okay.” It could be that she knows I have spent eighteen years trying to make good on something I chose when I was barely old enough to drink alcohol, or that she knows a bit about tying oneself to tradition and saving face. I will feel, for the first time, that my mother trusts me to make a decision.
I have a memory of my mother from when I was ten years old. We had moved to a cramped house surrounded by pecan trees in the old section of a tiny town in the Mojave desert, and she decided we would plant a garden. She showed us how to use a rake to till the clay near the sagging clothesline and to count the miniscule seeds we got for $.69 a packet at the local mercantile in the palm of our hands. Peppers and zucchini and carrots and radishes. I thought there was nothing to it. My grandmother had a large, prolific garden every year.
This garden would be a chore, my mother warned us—weeding every week and watering every day, sometimes twice during the hottest months. But it would yield something, she promised. And so we each tended our row of seedlings with anticipation, watching the infant plants sprout then shrivel under the intensity of sun. But we continued to water and weed and yearn.
By fall, most the plants had died or never produced anything edible. The only crop I remember coming through were the carrots. We each pulled a handful of pale, thin roots from the sandy earth and washed them under the yard spigot. They were only enough for a snack. One handful of carrots was all we could show for our months of endurance and cultivation and pursuit.  It left us with more than a handful of carrots, she argued.
In two days, my mother will leave for her home two states away, and I won’t see her until the following summer. She will tuck a couple hundred dollars into my coat pocket when I drop her off at the airport. Don’t be ashamed, she will tell me, of letting this go. No effort is ever wasted."

I can differentiate between cerulean
and cobalt—is this an attention to detail or an unhealthyobsession with labeling, with defining, with separating?Did you know blue is not a color? In my book, blue
is the body of origin, and indigo, azure, and aquamarineare infants who emerged from the womb via C-section.After the birth, the midwives—oceans of Mother Earth—
stained each little head a different shade of childhood,depending on the tides and the waves and the salinity of the ebb and flow. Perhaps I am woman only because
I possess the ability to birth color. I wonder what I willname the hue of my own newborn’s soft skin. I wonder if my child will ask me, as I once asked my mother,
why did the sun stain my body yellow? I was eight,and I wanted nothing more than to be pink and whiteand rosy, just like the girls at school. I wanted to be 
a flower. My mother narrowed her eyes and pursedher lips. She knew then, as she knows now, that whenit comes to tales spun about color, I never forget. Olive, 
she said. You are olive. I frowned and bit my lip. I thought of oil, of salt, of the tangy sting of each bitter, brined bulb.I wanted so much to be fragrant, to be worth inhaling, to be
worth picking and holding up to nose and lips, puckeredlike a kiss, to be worth the title of “beautiful.” Over the years,as my skin has hardened and continued to yellow, I’ve realized
that I have no choice but to surrender to the stains. My bodyis a solar landscape. I no longer try to define the waters of sky—instead, I name each ray of sun. As spring wafts into summer,
I become saffron for a fortnight before metallic heat blindsmy cheeks first into bronze, then brass. In winter, I am jasminewith a hint of ground ginger and dandelion. But it is in autumn
when Mother Earth holds me in her arms and blessesthe lemon zest freckled onto my temples—it is in autumnwhen I am gold.

My feet are cold and someone takes my hand and leads me away from where he’s doubled over on our couch. Something is wrong with Maw Maw, but I don’t know what. She took a nap while she was driving, they say, because of the diabetes, and they pat down my hair and my dress. My father’s hands muffle monster noises coming from his face. My momma’s gone, he says. Sometimes he takes little white pills in the mornings.

9It’s the year my cat, Baby, dies, but I don’t realize that for a long time. My father tells me that Baby was recruited by NASA and launched into space. I cut out an image of a white cat wearing an astronaut helmet and tape it to my bedroom wall.

10My father waits until the Home Depot aisle is empty, then opens a package. He takes out part of it, slips it into his waistband, beside his gun, and replaces the package on the shelf. He tucks his shirt in around his paunch. A woman in an electric orange apron squints at us. I feel a tap on my shoulder. Let’s go, he says. She makes eye contact with me, and I say nothing.

12At the bottom of my pool, I count to one hundred in French until my chest convulses. I shoot up to the surface. Sunshine is a hot twill smacking my face. I skim out snuff-colored leaves and drowned animals. White-bellied frogs with swollen limbs and cataract eyes. Their bodies disintegrate in the netting and small parts disperse in the water, creating a kind of death soup. My parents forget where I am. 

14The Columbine massacre happens on the other side of the country. Twelve students and one teacher are dead. Inside a wooden box on my parents’ dresser is a gun. In the coming years, my father will tap it against his palm when I arrive home past my ten o’clock curfew. It’s heavy and smells like sweat and metal. I point the barrel at my reflection in the vanity’s desilvering mirror. My father doesn’t mention the shooting. No one in my family does. It’s like it didn’t happen. But the gun stays in the box, the waistband, the glove compartment, the unstable man’s hands.

15My friend Brian and I lean into our plastic N64 controllers. The TV screen reflects off our shiny faces. Dinner is ready, but I ignore my mother’s call to come to the table. In an instant, my father’s hands are around my neck. He wrestles me to the floor and presses his knees into my shoulders. The last openhanded slap dislocates my jaw. Pain pins me to the carpet. Don’t you ever disrespect your mother, he says. Brian is a smudge slinking to the front door. I can’t lift my hand to wipe my father’s spit from my face. He releases me, and my feet squeak to the green linoleum kitchen floor. My mother drops chunks of chicken liver on my plate, breaded and fried. She lights a cigarette and sits. Dig in, she says.

16When I wake up, IV lines are coming out the inner parts of my arms and the top of my hand. I’m woken every few hours to take medicine. It involves a straw and bitter-tasting fluid. A nurse touches my shoulder. It’s always the pretty ones, she says. My mother arrives. She sits by my bedside. She holds down my arms so I can’t yank out tubes from my nose.
My room at the youth psychiatric hospital is so still. All the corners are folded down. Adults listen and respond when I speak. My questions are met with answers that make sense. My father arrives and demands I be discharged. AMA? Is that a good idea? the psychiatrist asks. But I’m being pulled out the front door. It swishes closed behind us. You cost me ten thousand dollars, my father says. I begin counting the days.

18Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” clatters out of my car radio speakers. My fingers tap the steering wheel in time with the fast tempo. I hand-crank the window and turn up the volume.

[1] The visitors arrive disheveled. The visitors remind each other the rules in the parking lot. The brother tells the brother no duh because as visitors, they’re on edge no matter how many times they’ve come. The sister fixes the front of a dress she’d normally not wear. Other visitors will be sent home. Several are newbies that think they’re guests. One visitor brought a newborn and doesn’t like how the guards check the diaper bag. Others look better her than me when they ask to search her person in another room. Some will be sent away because their inmate is not taking guests today. The younger brother visitor considers how that makes the prisoners sound like royalty, and how both are positions of status often conferred at birth.
The clocks wind or unwind depending on where you stand. The guards screen until a clipboard convinces them they’ve done their job. The guards are concerned that the term guard is too passive. Corrections officer, then, is a blanket. The corrections officer will not open one door until the previous door is closed. For these moments, which happen several times per visit, visitors are prisoners of process.
The prisoner will stand on the line. The prisoner will wait for the door. The prisoner won’t touch the visitor. The prisoner must show his hands in the photo or the photo can’t be taken. The photographer is a prisoner with special privileges. The prisoner cannot have a copy for himself, or depending which prison we’re at now, can be given the photo at a later date. The visitor struggles to keep track. The officers keep track of struggles. The visitor must not be late but cannot be early because they keep the doors locked around here. The visitors must possess no paraphernalia, which bans some colors but all logos; little brother kisses goodbye Raiders jerseys, god’s love and appeals to logic.
The guests are kids here to see their father. The father is a step-father, but it didn’t seem to matter ‘til now. The inmate asks about your mother because inmate is a temporary rooming situation. The mother doesn’t know you are still coming for visits. The visitors will carry no items with them except change for the vending machine. That is too much change for the vending machine. The visitor will not have an attitude about it. The prisoner will watch his mouth. The prisoner will watch his step. Watch this.
The visiting group will not speak to another group. The families will not embrace. If the corrections officer has to tell you again the prisoner will lose privileges. The inmates who are grown men will stop looking at your sister. The corrections officers who are also grown men will please stop looking at your sister. The inmates have five minutes. The convicts have all day, the latter a pejorative hurled at someone who’s not going anywhere. The inmate is twitchy. The inmate is not who you remember he was within these walls. The inmate can’t control you from here and maybe you can make a relationship out of that. The inmate’s sure of it. A stepson has his doubts. The convict’s lawyer has a plan of appeal. The convict’s friends who testified will complicate the plan. The inmate is the only guilty man he knows. The prison is far.         
The visitors are tired. The prison is at the border on purpose. The visitors had to leave before dawn to be there on time but not early. The ex-visitors still have a long drive home. The kids are pulled over out front where the local police sit in wait for anyone visiting the convicts. The cop who is a grown man eyes the little sister in a way that nearly gets the older brother pulled out of the car. The brother should watch his mouth. Watch this: the system’s an ocean. A case is a wave that crashes on the prison floor, the undertow just overture. We wade in its waters, awaiting recede. Sporadic dispatches from a sailor at sea come collect, if you’d like to accept press three."

I’m writing this on an ice cube, well, to be more accurate,
an icicle octagon, a wintery stop sign, the one near my home
in northern Michigan, where we moved because it was most

like Kuusamo, because we like places where there aren’t many
people, but a lot of snow. It’s difficult to write on an ice cube,
but no tougher than heating your home with wood. I remember

hauling wood, helling wood, being wood, how my childhood
was really childwood, the slaving over slivers, was my dad
and gloves, the path to the woodpile so memorized in my mind

that I see it now, daily, before bed, during bed, after bed, even
the few weeks when I moved into this apartment and didn’t have
a bed. But there it is. The pile. The wood. My dad. The sun.

The moon. The empty sky. The full sky. My dad would look
up at the sun and say, “Where’s its chimney?” We’d see God
hauling wood to the sun. He’d see each star as a sauna. He’d

sing the Finnish National Anthem, which began with “Our land,
our land” which really meant “Our wood, our wood,” and then
the next line—“Our fatherland”—my father singing this, his

voice echoing, father, land, fatherwood, sunwood, fatherGod,
the song, the heat, the cold, how they clashed, the song caught
fire, the sun ran out of heat, winter owned our lives, the house,

everything, and we walked backwards, to avoid the wind, and
got inside, and when I think of place I think of fireplace, of how
hot my back would be, my toes frozen, my father grabbing me

by the face, saying, straight into my iris, “You’re Finn! Finn!”
his hands so cold, my nose so sooty, my life so strange, night
like lightning, snow like heat, God like fury, the house so full.

All my life I feared death. Passionately, dutifully, sardonically, silently. But when it came, nothing changed. 

I still brush my teeth, worried the cinnamon dental floss will snag in a back molar. A nose hair protrudes. I can feel it between my thumb and forefinger but I can’t see it, no matter how I angle my face to the mirror. I dress in the clothes on top of the hamper. My shoes pinch.

I walk the dog on Eastern Parkway in the lightest of snows. If anything, I’m more present, focused on the leash, alert to yank him back from the things he loves in the gutter — a bloody tampon, the yellow intricate intestine that must have been a squirrel once. 

My neighbor Dolmatov is doling out peanuts to a flock of sparrows. They swoop in from nowhere, ignoring the dog’s outraged stare. The ones in front gobble — me! Me! The ones in back puff themselves up, flaunting the faint oil-slick iridescence of their wings. Their polls glisten with a sheen of sleet. Dolmatov rolls each kernel in his fingers and chooses the recipient: you and you.  With his free hand he cracks the shells. His ample belly props him against his walker.

“Snowy enough for you?” he asks. Like all neighbors, he knows nothing of death.                      

On the next block they are converting a padlocked factory into condos, working on Sunday in bitter cold. High silhouettes in flimsy parkas race across scaffolding, shouting jokes in Nahuatl or Bengali.                   

The child on his skateboard whizzes past me, close as he knows — there is no distance! Distance is mine! It takes all my strength to rein the dog in. 

Always when I was alive “life was elsewhere,” in a notebook washed blank in the laundromat, in a glance returned from the tinted window of a passing SUV. Perhaps death is also elsewhere?

The little Haredi girl wants to pet the dog — furtively, conscious of breaking a law — and the dog strains forward, fascinated.  Fascinated! Is that the only change? That and the swiftness of the clouds, passing from Jersey to the Verrazano in a heartbeat?

At night here are the tenements of my childhood. A single lit window reigns, making the city so vast, so empty. The face that shines there, always in profile — is that my father?

All my life I waited for you, passionately, bitterly, in silence, counting the breaths.

Including the poems I have yet to write.
For example, the one about the two
gray pubes, discovered during last Tuesday’s

trim. Or, the one about the fourth
hedgehog of the post-apocalypse. Or, the long,
tragic one about how the frenemy of your frenemy

is your frenemy. The short one that seems
to be about love, but is about
SUNY Geneseo. The one about my best friend who always

mistakes everyone for Anne Carson,
tentatively titled, “Why Canada Cannot Stop
Weeping.” Of course,

there’s the one that begins, Exquisitely
inquisitive, I wander with my well-moisturized elbows.
& ends, To aubergine or not to aubergine, that is

never the question. This great poem I will
never write, for I am too busy staring
at my graying or correcting my best friend. & in the end,

I only know the beginning & the end. Everything else
is a superlative question—a supervoid
I have come to view as my innermost joy.

Try to think, said the teacher,
of an image from your childhood.
Spoon, said one boy. Ah, said the teacher,
this is not an image. It is,
said the boy. See, I hold it in my hand
and on the convex side a room appears
but distorted, the middle taking longer to see
than the two ends. Yes, said the teacher, that is so.
But in the larger sense, it is not so: if you move your hand
even an inch, it is not so. You weren’t there, said the boy.
You don’t know how we set the table.
That is true, said the teacher. I know nothing
of your childhood. But if you add your mother
to the distorted furniture, you will have an image.
Will it be good, said the boy, a strong image?
Very strong, said the teacher.
Very strong and full of foreboding.

Dear child of the near future,
here is what I know—hawks

soar on the updraft and sparrows always
return to the seed source until they spot

the circling hawk. Then they disappear
for days and return, a full flock,

ready. I think we all have the power
to do what we must to survive.

One day, I hope to set a table, invite you
to draw up a chair. Greens steaming garlic.

Slices of bread, still warm. Honey flecked with wax,
and a pitcher of clear water. Sustenance for acts

of survival, for incantations
stirring across our tongues. Can we climb

out of this greedy mouth,
disappear, and then return in force?

My stars are tucked in my pocket,
ready for battle. If we flood

the streets with salt water, we can
flood the sky with wings.

De piedra, sangre.

I make my own heaven. I drag it out of the streets, and inhospitable terrains.    I mixed ""tabique"", brick, mortar with my hands, kneading,

I need, to make my own heaven.


It is clandestine, in broad daylight.

 

It's microwave popcorn, from Costco, because Costco can cross the border as many times as it wants and it has never been asked to go back to where it came from. Not in this kitchen, scrubbed so clean, with bleach, that the roaches have to ask permission to scatter out onto the floor.

Sulema and I, don't flinch. She has figured me out. We know we have lived some shit and now, it takes more than a cockroach to keep us from moving, forward.

Fuck the roaches, the military, the long nights and even longer days. There is popcorn to be made,

a courtyard of children waiting for it.

Baby girl walks in to check on our progress. She is waiting impatiently for popcorn, the smell of butter making its way around the shelter, La Casa.

The house is built on a solid foundation of Goodyear tires, and unpacked, repacked, suitcases, unpacked, repacked plans.

Today, there is popcorn.

All that matters is today.

For my sake, not Sulema's


The flowerbeds, and the upside-down Christmas trees, drying out in the sun are beautiful.


 

I will remember them, when I am warm by a campfire, watching my children for signs of a chill.

I will remember them,

determined,

uneven steps, protruding out of a hillside, going wherever they need to go.

 

Wherever they need to go.

There is no going back.

Sulema and I both know this, standing in the hot kitchen of the TJ shelter, it is obvious.


 

It is a beautiful truth, it takes hesitation and beats it down, into the floor.


We danced on it.

of memory grew into cautionary tales

A vase with three wilted lilies sits off-center on the table in the dining room where my father trembles as he says, “You’re the most worthless son.” He shakes his fists at the disappointment that repulses him. He raises his voice. “Twenty-one years old and you can’t start a lawnmower. Or build a sandbox.” I am the fool who lost his last-chance job at the fiberglass insulation plant. A bowl of dusty Butterscotch candies rests at the far end of the table. My breath tastes sour. Neither of us has brushed his teeth. I stand before my father’s prediction. “You’ll never amount to anything much more than a ditch digger.” A Pomeranian with an overbite worries itself at our feet. Sunlight prisms my eyes from the east windows. Pimpling my face with another dose of shame. I see how rage clenches my father’s eyes into ruthless squints. He says, “You wet your bed for eighteen years. You killed your mother.” And once again my father restrains himself from blackening my eye or breaking my nose. Maybe with the last vestiges of love.

It’s very difficult to plan something if your day is constantly interrupted by dead things. The cat lays two dead mice at your feet, one after the other dropping from her red-tinged mouth and you stop packing the lunch boxes. You marvel at the irony: two dead mice, two hungry children. Somewhere in this house are two mothers with two children depending on them. You think about taking the mouse mother out to lunch. Are all children furred and tiny? you will ask her. Are all children silent and maimed?

Depending on the day, you either put the mice in a Ziploc, draw a heart on the bag and feel proud that there’s something new to feed the children, or you focus on the task at hand. If you are a decent mother, you smile benevolently, teeth wide, white, and showing, good humor not quite reaching your eyes. You say, Good kitty. Never change. You never say, They had it coming. You never curse the cat’s ambition. Out of the corner of your eye you see a shadow. You dial your dead ex-husband, but the call goes to voice mail. Not mourning, but you’d like to know what he did with dead mice.

At some point, you remember about lunch. As usual, the sticky note on your cupboard door has failed you: Don’t forget to feed them.

No one tells you how to mourn. You ask your mother. She says, Try baking a casserole. You ask your children. They say, What’s for dinner? You’re still not sure if your dead ex-husband is dead or a divorcee. Isn’t that a nice word? you ask the cat. Doesn’t it sound like a fancy name? You read papers about division of assets, equitable distribution. You take out the hedge trimmers he left behind, put on the blue flannel shirt he forgot on the back of the bathroom door and measure as much of the house as you can with a tape measure. Should I draw a line with chalk? you ask the cat, then walk back inside to search for a chainsaw.

It's still Monday morning, you shout at the mailman. The children have boarded the bus without their crustless peanut butter and jellies, without their clementines swaddled inside seasonally themed napkins and love notes. I’m coming, you shout to the cat. Tell the children. The shadow you saw earlier shakes its head, reaches out and shoves you out the door. Is it any surprise when you slip on the mess of a fledgling that has fallen from its nest inside your porch light? Any surprise that you are overjoyed at the prospect of erasing the death, resurrecting the lunch? Not the death of a mother, but the demise of a life well-intentioned.

No one can see the man floating alongside you as you push your cart through the produce aisle, fondle the avocados, wonder how many germs you’ve left, how many you’ve picked up. Ghosts don’t worry about germs, and they don’t have a sense of personal space. Your dead ex-husband is in your personal space, and all you can say, over and over as you wait in the deli line behind a gray-haired woman with her slip showing, is, Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. You got that right, you think you hear her say, as she orders the last pound of American cheese in the deli case.

Death makes for a poor bedfellow. Your memories are cadavers. Your first date after becoming single is a noon-time disaster of dead air, dead chicken, and dead mother-in-law jokes. He’s a nice guy, as morticians go, but his jokes can’t raise a sleepwalker from the dead, and he smells like formaldehyde. You have asked the waiter for three new knives. Each one is duller than the next, and it’s not until you are finally carving your baked breast that you remember the children. They are still at school, and you still haven’t delivered their lunches.

I have so many things I haven’t done that I need to discard

Old newspapers stacked like accomplishments

Unread books staring out the window

Learning I never learned everything there is to know

 

Bright as the sun blinded me

I caught one pass over my head, it took two hands

I got lucky more than once

Unlucky more than twice

 

Worked like a dog, rewarded like a rat

Pats on the back left a bruise

Knowing the heavy branches did not bend under my weight

Top of the pile is not top of the pyramid

 

Myopic in one eye, the hyperopic one drifted off

Focused on stratocirrus desire, cumulous satisfaction

Achievement in small bites, disappointment in gulps

Threads twisted in knots too tough to unravel

 

Concentric circles orbit the years

Intimacy afraid to touch me

Dalliance sour milk

Shame a pair of mittens

 

Confidence rarely takes a chance

Loneliness a raked pile of leaves

Depression has no depth perception

I am sewn in patches

 

Simplifying is survival of the fittest

Casting without allure I caught what I expected

Shuffled the cards and repeated the error

My mistake: optimism, hope’s grindstone

 

Still, I tug on the sword in the stone

Look to the horizon and swear it is closer

Leave footprints in the sand every time the tide goes out

Sharpen the knife and test its edge

 

Go forward without looking left or right

Bargain with the devil but refuse his best offer

Convince myself the water is not that deep

I cannot swim but manage to float

 

Now I know the secret

The key I was given never fit the lock

I set aside my one-size-fits-all shirt,

my pants with the elastic tummy-panel,

as music to a silent world of hurt

strains from a distant country-western channel.

 

Still, there’s compassion. I’ve been granted leave —

a week in which to heal and convalesce,

to peel away the glow-stars, to unweave

the year I’d stitched onto your christening dress.

 

I rearrange my premises — perverse

assumptions! — gather unripe figs. Throw out

the bloodied bedclothes. Scour the universe

in search of you. And God. And go about

my business as my crooked smile displays

the artful look of ordinary days.
